Deep Learning + Arts = ArtsyNetworks
=======

This is an humble attempt to implement the algorithm described in `http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576
<http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576>`_ by Gatys, Ecker and Bethge. The code is inspired by *Lasagne Recipe* - `styletransfer <https://github.com/Lasagne/Recipes/blob/master/examples/styletransfer/Art%20Style%20Transfer.ipynb>`_ 
 

Dependencies:

* theano
* lasagne
* skimage
* matplotlib


How to Run?
------------

From command line:

.. code-block:: bash

  python art_it_up.py base_image style_image
